title: How I became a better Data Scientist
---
### Introduction
Hi. I'm Jenn. I've been at Metis for over a week now, and I can confidently say that I am a better Data Scientist than when I  started. 
(Yes, that was a stats joke.)

Prior to Metis, I had a basic understanding of what Data Science is. It was enough to peak my curiousity, and make me want to delve deeper. I thought that bootcamp was the best decision for me. And it was.

This first week has demystified the field for me. Like most people, when I thought of Data Science, my mind immediately went to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc. 

But beyond the advanced technologies we can leverage, I want to shed light on what I think is the objective of Data Science. I believe that it is to gain insight. 

The most important lesson I learned this week is to ask clear questions that have tangible impact.
Let me repeat that one more time.
The point of Data Science is to gain insight to make a tangible impact.

It took me a long time to realize and internalize this. But it makes sense if you think about it. There is no practical reason to invest your limited resources into something that does not have a large return, especially when there are many other ways to make a larger impact. This is achieved by asking good questions, something that requires practice and domain knowledge. Both of which are acquired from experience.

So that's the secret to becoming a better Data Science--getting experience. The best way to get better at doing something is to just do it. Go forth and make an impact!
