    "Drop It Like It's Hot. How I Leveraged Data Science To Deconstruct Hit Songs"
</head>

<body>
    So I am officially in my fourth week of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. I've learned so much, and now feel that I am more equipped with the tools necessary to answer questions that I am interested in. <break> </break>
    One of my biggest goals in life is to work on products that will help people connect with experiences that help them see and appreciate beauty in life. One of my favorite products is Spotify, so naturally I wanted to do something with it. The question I sought to answer was if I could predict how many weeks a given song would break the Billboards Top 100 Weekly Charts. <break>

    In trying to answer this question, I had to explore what available resources I had within my reach. One of the goals of this project was learning to scrape webpages to gather data to use in our predictive model. I chose to scrape Billboard.com and went all the way back to 1958 when they first started to release the Weekly Top 100 Charts. I also discovered the Kaggle Million Song Dataset which contained many features of various songs, that I could try to utilize in my model!
