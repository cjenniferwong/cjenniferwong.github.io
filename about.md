_Data to information,
information to knowledge,
knowledge to wisdom._

  I'm a Data Scientist based in San Francisco, CA. I'm interested in Decision Sciences of B2C consumer products, most recently as a Product Analyst at <a href="postmates.com">Postmates</a>.     
  <br> <br>

  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnf4DD0cqGeWD-iSV1_syZfjWEAVttXzc0wUTG8CAjw/edit?usp=sharing"> Here is a product analysis </a> that I did for RealTalk.
<br>
<br>
  I am particularly excited about experimentation, and high-dimensional unstructured data. <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-whole-new-meaning-to-wym-topic-modeling-with-non-negative-matrix-factorization-d8813b296e95"> My work has contributed to the Analytics Vidhya publication on Medium.</a> This post was inspired by my project on Topic Modeling <a href="https://github.com/cjenniferwong/topic_modeling/blob/master/nmf_topic_modeling_jennwong.ipynb">(repo)</a>.

  I frequently think and write about Statistics. Here is a recent experiment that I analyzed <a href="">(repo)</a>. This inspired me to build an app that aims to visualize statistical concepts, something that I am passionate about. You can find it <a href="mo-better.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

  <br>

  My interests in data, health, and media stems from my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley (coupled with the occasional terrible pun). You can find my talk on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fCijsxB1O74Oe6BGo2l_QMsgWgeS-s06ebPwjCyN3Qk/edit?usp=sharing"> Spotify's Recommendation System here!</a>
  <br>
  <br>

  I am also deeply passionate about ethics, and the role that data/tech plays in the world. I gave a talk on <a ref="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zWmNnnUS_rVfHccgb5P6FbvxnhyXj5Hzg5Yl1RiZhDM/edit?usp=sharing">Data Science and Ethics (2018)</a> which inspired a new module dedicated on Ethics to be taught!

  <br>
  I volunteer for Women in Machine Learning and Data Science, San Francisco chapter. <a href="https://medium.com/wimlds-bay-area-blog/recap-wimlds-x-quora-a-night-of-data-analytics-948e6d106804"> You can read my writing here. </a>
