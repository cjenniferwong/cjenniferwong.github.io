_Data to information,
information to knowledge,
knowledge to wisdom._

<p class="message">
  I'm a Data Scientist based in San Francisco, CA. I'm interested in Decision Sciences of B2C consumer products, most recently as a Product Analyst at <a href="postmates.com">Postmates</a>.

  I am particularly excited about experimentation, and high-dimensional unstructured data.

  My interested in data, health, and media stems from my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley (coupled with the occasional terrible pun).

  I am also deeply passionate about ethics, and the role that data/tech plays in the world. I gave a talk on <a ref="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zWmNnnUS_rVfHccgb5P6FbvxnhyXj5Hzg5Yl1RiZhDM/edit?usp=sharing">Data Science and Ethics (2018)</a> which inspired a new module dedicated on Ethics to be taught!
