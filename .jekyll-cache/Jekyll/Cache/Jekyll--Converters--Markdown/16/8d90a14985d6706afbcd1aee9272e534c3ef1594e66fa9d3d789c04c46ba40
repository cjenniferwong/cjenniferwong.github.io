<p class="message">
  I'm a Data Scientist based in San Francisco, CA. I'm interested in Decision Sciences of B2C consumer products, most recently as a Product Analyst at <a href="postmates.com">Postmates</a>.

  I am particularly excited about experimentation, and high-dimensional unstructured data.

  My interested in data, health, and media stems from my undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley (coupled with the occasional terrible pun).

<!--- stuff that came with the original template


In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
